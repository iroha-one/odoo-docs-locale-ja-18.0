This can cause poor user experience: the user sees an element on the page that was initially rendered and with which they want to interact, so they move their cursor or finger above that element.

After this, if `preventDefault` was not called on the error event, and if the error service was able to add a stack trace on the wrapper error object, the error service calls `preventDefault` on the error event, and logs the stack trace in the console.

And if you want to avoid having to reassign the variable you may move the entire block that uses the variable inside the `try` block.

One2many and Many2many use special 'commands' which have been made human readable with the :class:`~odoo.fields.Command` namespace.
